# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! A few simple guidelines to keep the repo friendly:

- Keep notebooks runnable from the repository root. Prefer relative paths like `DataSets/<file>.csv`.
- Keep code style simple and readable — use small helper modules for reusable code.
- If you add large datasets, put them behind `DataSets/` and consider adding a download script rather than checking in large files.
- Open a pull request with a short description of the changes and which notebooks were tested.

If in doubt, open an issue and we'll discuss.
